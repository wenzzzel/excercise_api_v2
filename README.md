# excercise_api_v2
REST API built with dotnet core for an excercise application. Same use case as my other repo excercise_api, but with CosmosDB instead of SQL Server Database. Also using Azure AD Managed Identity Authentication + Authorization instead of managing the auth parts in my own SQL Server database using Microsoft Identity.
