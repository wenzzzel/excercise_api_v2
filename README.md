# excercise_api_v2
REST API built with dotnet core for an excercise application. Same usecase as my other repo excercise_api, but with CosmosDB instead of SQL Server, for persistence. And Azure AD Managed Identity Authentication + Authorization instead of the Microsoft Identity SQL server setup for authentication and authorization.
